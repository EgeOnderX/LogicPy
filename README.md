# LogicPy
A Python-based interactive logic gate simulator with drag-and-drop components, wiring, saving, loading, and real-time circuit evaluation.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop placement of logic gates and components  
- Interactive wiring system with bend points  
- Switches to toggle signals ON/OFF  
- LEDs to display outputs in real-time  
- Save and load circuits (JSON format)  
- Real-time evaluation of logic gates  
- Delete components and wires easily
**Note:** Your circuit will be saved and loaded using the file named `circuit.json`.
**Warning:** Be careful! Saving will overwrite the existing `circuit.json` file!
### Supported Components

- **Logic Gates:** AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR  
- **Input Components:** Switch  
- **Output Components:** LED  
- **Wires:** Connect components with flexible wiring and bend points

## Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed  
2. Install pygame and numpy:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame, numpy
   ```  
3. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <(https://github.com/EgeOnderX/LogicPy)>
   ```  
4. Run the simulator:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Click on a component from the sidebar to select it  
- Click on the canvas to place the selected component  
- Drag components to reposition them  
- Click on slots to start and end wiring  
- Right-click on wires or components to delete them  
- Press `S` to save the current circuit  
- Press `L` to load the last saved circuit
